# Installing

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk-generated.git
```

Use your GitHub account login and GitHub Personal access token as a password when prompt.
Guide how to obtain GitHub Personal access token can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

This is autogenerated Box SDK Beta version. The engine used for generating this SDK can be found [here](https://github.com/box/box-codegen).
Supported Python versions are Python 3.7 and above.

# Getting Started

To get started with the SDK, get a Developer Token from the Configuration page of your app in the [Box Developer
Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console). You can use this token to make test calls for your own Box account.

The SDK provides an `DeveloperTokenAuth` class, which allows you to authenticate using your Developer Token.
Use instance of `DeveloperTokenAuth` to initialize `Client` object.
Using `Client` object you can access managers, which allow you to perform some operations on your Box account.

The example below demonstrates how to authenticate with Developer Token and print names of all items inside a root folder.

```python
from box_sdk.developer_token_auth import DeveloperTokenAuth
from box_sdk.client import Client


def main(token: str):
    auth: DeveloperTokenAuth = DeveloperTokenAuth(token=token)
    client: Client = Client(auth=auth)
    for item in client.folders.get_folders_id_items('0').entries:
        print(item.name)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main('INSERT YOUR DEVELOPER TOKEN HERE')
```
